# svg-logo-maker-cw

## Description

This was a cool project becuase it helped me learn all the cool things i can do with node and helped me to practice building SVG! The main purpose of it is to provide a way to make simple eay logos through your terminal!

## Usage

The best way to use this program is to run the index.js through node. When you do so, a series of prompts will appear allowing you to make the logo that you would like!
